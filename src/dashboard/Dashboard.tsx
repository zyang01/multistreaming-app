			<p>Hello, I'm one of the panels in your bundle! I'm where you put your controls.</p>

			<p>
				To edit me, open "<span className="monospace">src/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx</span>" in your favorite text
				editor or IDE.
			</p>

			<p>
				You can use any libraries, frameworks, and tools you want. The only limit of panels is that they cannot
				render outside of their
				<span className="monospace">&lt;iframe&gt;</span>'s bounding box.
